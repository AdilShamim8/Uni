// Local provenance and integrity hash: third_party/sources.lock.json
// Modifications: extraction plus one text change — the RECALL_OPEN disclosure
// names Uni instead of OpenMausBot; recallQuery's dependency on recallTerms
// moved into this file; matchedTerms brackets ([term]) are no longer FTS5
// output but explicit markers the caller can emit. `enoughMatches` keeps its
// upstream contract (>= 2 distinct matched terms for long queries). The
// SQLite FTS5 machinery was NOT ported — Uni matches terms against
// PostgreSQL-stored notes in backend/src/modules/memory.
