A few notes on the shape:

- The result type forces callers to handle both outcomes explicitly.
- Backoff grows linearly rather than exponentially to keep the demo snappy.
- The snippet is fixture content rendered with syntax highlighting and a copy button — nothing is executed.`

| Approach | Best for | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep it local | Privacy and speed | No collaboration yet |
| Share a copy | Quick feedback | Copies drift from the source |
| Sync later | Team workflows | Needs the integration milestone |

Tables scroll inside their own container, so long cells never break the page layout.

> This table is illustrative demo content, not research output.`

const LIST_RESPONSE = (topic: string) => `Here are a few directions for **${topic}**:

1. **Start with the smallest useful slice** — something you can finish in one sitting.
2. **Make the feedback loop visible** — a checklist or a short log beats a vague plan.
3. **Set a review point** — one honest look at the end beats three anxious ones during.
4. **Park the tangents** — keep a side list so curiosity is captured, not followed.
5. **Decide what "done" means** before starting; ambiguity is where momentum goes to rest.

Pick one and I can expand it into concrete steps.`

- **What matters most:** clarity about the outcome before choosing the method.
- **A practical step:** write down the constraint that hurts most; design around it first.
- **What to ignore for now:** anything that only matters if this works twice as well, twice as fast.
