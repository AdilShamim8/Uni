## Summary

This report demonstrates the shape of a Uni research result: a short synthesis, structured findings with numbered citations, open questions, and a transparent source list. In a later milestone the same interface will be driven by a real provider adapter, with the evidence trail kept equally explicit.

## Key findings

1. **Framing matters.** The brief — “${topic}” — is best approached by separating what is known, what is assumed, and what is decidable now. [1]
2. **Small verified beats large assumed.** Evidence gathered from a few checkable sources outperforms broad but unverified claims when the goal is a decision. [2]
3. **Write the summary last.** Synthesis is a verification pass: if the summary cannot be traced back to the sources, the research is not done. [3]

## Open questions

- Which constraints are fixed, and which are merely habitual?
- What would change the conclusion if it were wrong?
- Who is the audience, and what do they need to do with this?

export const CANVAS_DOCUMENT = `# Project brief — neighborhood tool library

**Goal:** a small lending shelf for tools that neighbors use rarely but
everyone needs occasionally.

## Scope for the first month

- One shelf, twelve tools, a paper sign-out sheet
- A weekend launch event with coffee and a fix-it table
- A simple rule: borrow for a week, return working

## Open questions

- Where does the shelf live in winter?
- Who repairs what breaks, and with what budget?
- Do we need any permissions for the launch event?

_Note: this document is a bundled fixture. Edits stay in this panel for
the session and are not persisted.`
